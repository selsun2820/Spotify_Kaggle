#### Spotify_Kaggle
##### This project to be completed individually involves performing steps of predictive analysis including exploring and tidying data, fitting competing models, selecting features, tuning model hyperparameters, interpreting results and presenting findings.

##### To clean the raw data where a single column contained all the genres for each song in Spotify, I utilized R's "separate_rows" function to separate the genres into individual categories, in order to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the Ranger model.
